## Seeding Demo Data

To populate the database with demo users, attendance, time off, and payroll records:

```bash
cd Backend
python seed.py
```

This creates 6 users:

| Role | Login ID | Password | Name |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| Admin | EMP001 | admin123 | Alice Admin |
| HR Officer | EMP002 | hr123 | Bob HR |
| Payroll Officer | EMP003 | payroll123 | Carol Payroll |
| Employee | EMP004 | emp123 | David Dev |
| Employee | EMP005 | emp123 | Eva Sales |
| Employee | EMP006 | emp123 | Frank Design |

Also seeds:
- 30 days of attendance records for employees (weekdays only, 90% present)
- 5 time off requests with mixed statuses
- 3 months of payroll records (Feb, Mar, Apr 2025)

> ⚠️ Running seed.py clears all existing data first.
